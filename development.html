      <h2>What is Matrix Factorization?</h2>
      <p>Matrix Factorization is a machine learning technique that breaks down large data tables into smaller patterns ‚Äî helping us uncover hidden relationships between users (tenants) and items (technicians).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How DPM Applies It</h2>
      <p>DPM learns from previous maintenance jobs, technician skills, zones, urgency levels, and feedback ratings. It builds a matrix of scores, and factorizes it to recommend the most suitable technician for new requests ‚Äî even if ratings are missing.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>We Can Assign the Right Technician to Any Job</h2>
      <p>With just a few details like the type of issue, the tenant's zone, and urgency, DPM can accurately predict and assign the best technician ‚Äî no manual guesswork required. Whether it‚Äôs electrical, plumbing, or HVAC, we‚Äôve got it covered.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why It Works</h2>
      <p>It avoids guesswork and manual assignments. It handles sparse data, improves over time, and ensures balanced workloads based on skill and proximity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Example in Action</h2>
      <p>Tenant A in Zone 2 submits a plumbing issue. DPM checks technician skillsets, urgency, and zone match ‚Äî even if there's no prior data for this tenant. Matrix factorization predicts which technician is most compatible and sends the request instantly.</p>
